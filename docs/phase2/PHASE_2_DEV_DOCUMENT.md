# Phase 2 Developer Guide

This guide aggregates the developer-facing workflows for the Crowd Walrus Phase 2 release.
Detailed event schemas now live in `docs/phase2/EVENT_SCHEMAS.md` and serve as the
authoritative reference for indexers completing Task J1.

Upcoming sections (to be completed alongside Task L1) will capture:
- Programmable Transaction Block patterns for campaign creation and donor flows.
- Admin operations for token onboarding, badge configuration, and preset management.
- Integration guidance for fetching and attaching Pyth price updates.

Contributors should extend this document with those flows while keeping
`EVENT_SCHEMAS.md` focused solely on indexer event consumption.
