[warning] Client/Server api version mismatch, client api version : 1.60.0, server api version : 1.62.0
[warning] CLI's protocol version is 101, but the active network's protocol version is 104. 
 Consider installing the latest version of the CLI - https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install 

 If publishing/upgrading returns a dependency verification error, then install the latest CLI version.
[Note]: Dependency sources are no longer verified automatically during publication and upgrade. You can pass the `--verify-deps` option if you would like to verify them as part of publication or upgrade.
[warning]: The network is using protocol version ProtocolVersion(101), but this binary only recognizes protocol version ProtocolVersion(104); the system packages used for compilation (e.g. MoveStdlib) may be out of date. If you have errors related to system packages, you may need to update your CLI.
